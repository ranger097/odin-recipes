    <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3><br>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Taco Shells:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br>
                    Brush each flour tortilla with melted butter on both sides.<br>
                    In a small bowl, mix granulated sugar and ground cinnamon.<br>
                    Sprinkle the mixture over the buttered tortillas.<br>
                    Gently fold each tortilla in half and place them in between the <br>
                    grates of your oven rack, creating a taco shape. Bake for about 8-10 <br>
                    minutes until they're golden and crispy. Allow them to cool before filling.
                
        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a bowl, mix the mixed berries, chopped bananas, <br>
                    and chopped mango. Toss in the mini chocolate chips for an added touch of <br>
                    sweetness and texture.
                
        </li><br>


        <li><strong>Make the Chocolate Drizzle:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, <br>
                    combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream. Microwave in 20-second intervals, <br>
                    stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
                
        </li><br>


        <li><strong>Assemble the Dessert Tacos:</strong> Gently open each cooled taco shell. <br>
                    Spoon the mixed berry and fruit mixture into the taco shells. <br>
                    Drizzle the melted chocolate over the filling.
                
        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Top and Serve:</strong> Finish off your dessert tacos with a dollop of whipped cream <br>
                    on top of each taco. Serve immediately and enjoy this delightful combination of flavors and textures.
